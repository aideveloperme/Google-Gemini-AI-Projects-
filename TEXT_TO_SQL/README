NL2SQL: Natural Language to SQL Query Application
Description

This project is an interactive Streamlit application that converts natural language questions into SQL queries using Google Gemini 2.0 LLM. Users can type English questions, and the system automatically generates SQL queries, executes them on a SQLite database, and returns the results in real-time.
